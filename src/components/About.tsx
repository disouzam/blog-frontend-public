      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This blog or website is an unambitious personal project that I am
        kicking off in early 2025. Its boundaries are not clear yet while my
        internal reasons to build it are consolidated.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might cover from personal hobbies and experiences like photography
        and cycling to professional topics like software development and project
        management without trying to be prescriptive to anyone or sounding like
        a professional advice (for free).
      </p>
      <p>
        One central point that I want to express through this website is my
        quest for learning and passion for technology, especially software
        development and architecture. It wouldn't be complete, however, if
        metallurgy, materials science and engineering in general were not part
        of it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a considerate amount of my professional career, I have been involved
        in professional software development and this journey has not been easy:
        I had to overcome my lack of formal education in computer science or
        software development to be able to understand what is going on. The
        prize is that today I have a mix of skills and experiences that are not
        common to find (notice that they might not be awesome) and, above all,
        provides me confidence to tackle new challenges and the joy of
        achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, soon, I'll update it with news on the content, better styling and
        ideas of where it is going to go!
