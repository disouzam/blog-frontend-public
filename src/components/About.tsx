          This blog or website is an unambitious personal project that I am
          kicking off in early 2025. Its boundaries are not clear yet while my
          internal reasons to build it are consolidated.
        </p>
        <p className="text-start">
          It might cover from personal hobbies and experiences like photography
          and cycling to professional topics like software development and
          project management without trying to be prescriptive to anyone or
          sounding like a professional advice (for free).
        </p>
        <p className="text-start">
          One central point that I want to express through this website is my
          quest for learning and passion for technology, especially software
          development and architecture. It wouldn't be complete, however, if
          metallurgy, materials science and engineering in general were not part
          of it as well.
        </p>
        <p className="text-start">
          In a considerate amount of my professional career, I have been
          involved in professional software development and this journey has not
          been easy: I had to overcome my lack of formal education in computer
          science or software development to be able to understand what is going
          on. The prize is that today I have a mix of skills and experiences
          that are not common to find (notice that they might not be awesome)
          and, above all, provides me confidence to tackle new challenges and
          the joy of achievement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-start">
          So, soon, I'll update it with news on the content, better styling and
          ideas of where it is going to go!
